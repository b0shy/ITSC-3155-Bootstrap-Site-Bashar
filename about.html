        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h4>
            Guidance is the new key way for college students to manage and maximize their time and goals throughout
            their
            college experience. Upon starting college courses the user will put in their major, class schedule, work
            schedule
            and any upcoming assignments they have so they can plan their time accordingly. As time goes on and the
            student
            checks off more classes they will begin to be paired with internships and jobs that apply to what the
            student has
            been studying. Upon graduation our app would focus predominantly on the user being placed in a career/entry
            level job.
